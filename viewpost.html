                        <h2>How to Create a Chain Reaction of Good Habits</h2>

                    <br><span
                        style="font-size: 20px;"><em>Human behaviors are often tied to one another.</em><br></span>

                    For example, consider the case of a woman named Jennifer Dukes Lee. For two and a half decades
                    during her adult life, starting when she left for college and extending into her 40s, Lee never
                    made her bed except for when her mother or guests dropped by the house.

                    At some point, she decided to give it another try and managed to make her bed four days in a
                    row—a seemingly trivial feat. However, on the morning of that fourth day, when she finished
                    making the bed, she also picked up a sock and folded a few clothes lying around the bedroom.
                    Next, she found herself in the kitchen, pulling the dirty dishes out of the sink and loading
                    them into the dishwasher, then reorganizing the Tupperware in a cupboard and placing an
                    ornamental pig on the counter as a centerpiece.

                    She later explained, “My act of bed-making had set off a chain of small household tasks… I felt
                    like a grown-up—a happy, legit grown-up with a made bed, a clean sink, one decluttered cupboard,
                    and a pig on the counter. I felt like a woman who had miraculously pulled herself up from the
                    energy-sucking Bermuda Triangle of Household Chaos.”
                    The Domino Effect

                    The Domino Effect states that when you make a change to one behavior it will activate a chain
                    reaction and cause a shift in related behaviors as well.

                    For example, a 2012 study from researchers at Northwestern University found that when people
                    decreased their amount of sedentary leisure time each day, they also reduced their daily fat
                    intake. The participants were never specifically told to eat less fat, but their nutrition
                    habits improved as a natural side effect because they spent less time on the couch watching
                    television and mindlessly eating. One habit led to another, one domino knocked down the next.

                    You may notice similar patterns in your own life. As a personal example, if I stick with my
                    habit of going to the gym, then I naturally find myself more focused at work and sleeping more
                    soundly at night even though I never made a plan to specifically improve either behavior.

                    The Domino Effect holds for negative habits as well. You may find that the habit of checking
                    your phone leads to the habit of clicking social media notifications which leads to the habit of
                    browsing social media mindlessly which leads to another 20 minutes of procrastination.

                    In the words of Stanford professor BJ Fogg, “You can never change just one behavior. Our
                    behaviors are interconnected, so when you change one behavior, other behaviors also shift.”

                    Before we talk about how to get started, I wanted to let you know I researched and compiled
                    science-backed ways to stick to good habits and stop procrastinating. Want to check out my

                    Inside the Domino Effect

                    As best I can tell, the Domino Effect occurs for two reasons.

                    First, many of the habits and routines that make up our daily lives are related to one another.
                    There is an astounding interconnectedness between the systems of life and human behavior is no
                    exception. The inherent relatedness of things is a core reason why choices in one area of life
                    can lead to surprising results in other areas, regardless of the plans you make.

                    Second, the Domino Effect capitalizes on one of the core principles of human behavior:
                    commitment and consistency. This phenomenon is explained in the classic book on human behavior,
                    Influence by Robert Cialdini. The core idea is that if people commit to an idea or goal, even in
                    a very small way, they are more likely to honor that commitment because they now see that idea
                    or goal as being aligned with their self-image.
