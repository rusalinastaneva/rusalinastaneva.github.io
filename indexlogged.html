                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        For example, consider the case of a woman named Jennifer Dukes Lee. For two and a half decades
                        during her adult life, starting when she left for college and extending into her 40s, Lee never
                        made her bed except for when her mother or guests dropped by the house.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        At some point, she decided to give it another try and managed to make her bed four days in a
                        row—a seemingly trivial feat. However, on the morning of that fourth day, when she finished
                        making the bed, she also picked up a sock and folded a few clothes lying around the bedroom.
                        Next, she found herself in the kitchen, pulling the dirty dishes out of the sink and loading
                        them into the dishwasher, then reorganizing the Tupperware in a cupboard and placing an
                        ornamental pig on the counter as a centerpiece.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        She later explained, “My act of bed-making had set off a chain of small household tasks… I felt
                        like a grown-up—a happy, legit grown-up with a made bed, a clean sink, one decluttered cupboard,
                        and a pig on the counter. I felt like a woman who had miraculously pulled herself up from the
                        energy-sucking Bermuda Triangle of Household Chaos.”

                    <br><span style="font-size: 20px;"><em><strong>The Domino Effect</strong></em><br></span>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        The Domino Effect states that when you make a change to one behavior it will activate a chain
                        reaction and cause a shift in related behaviors as well.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        For example, a 2012 study from researchers at Northwestern University found that when people
                        decreased their amount of sedentary leisure time each day, they also reduced their daily fat
                        intake. The participants were never specifically told to eat less fat, but their nutrition
                        habits improved as a natural side effect because they spent less time on the couch watching
                        television and mindlessly eating. One habit led to another, one domino knocked down the next.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        You may notice similar patterns in your own life. As a personal example, if I stick with my
                        habit of going to the gym, then I naturally find myself more focused at work and sleeping more
                        soundly at night even though I never made a plan to specifically improve either behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        The Domino Effect holds for negative habits as well. You may find that the habit of checking
                        your phone leads to the habit of clicking social media notifications which leads to the habit of
                        browsing social media mindlessly which leads to another 20 minutes of procrastination.
                        In the words of Stanford professor BJ Fogg, “You can never change just one behavior. Our
                        behaviors are interconnected, so when you change one behavior, other behaviors also shift.”
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Before we talk about how to get started, I wanted to let you know I researched and compiled
                        science-backed ways to stick to good habits and stop procrastinating. Want to check out my

                        Inside the Domino Effect
                    </p>
                    <p>As best I can tell, the Domino Effect occurs for two reasons.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        First, many of the habits and routines that make up our daily lives are related to one another.
                        There is an astounding interconnectedness between the systems of life and human behavior is no
                        exception. The inherent relatedness of things is a core reason why choices in one area of life
                        can lead to surprising results in other areas, regardless of the plans you make.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Second, the Domino Effect capitalizes on one of the core principles of human behavior:
                        commitment and consistency. This phenomenon is explained in the classic book on human behavior,
                        Influence by Robert Cialdini. The core idea is that if people commit to an idea or goal, even in
                        a very small way, they are more likely to honor that commitment because they now see that idea
                        or goal as being aligned with their self-image.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Often times we are certain about what we want and how to get it. Strategies, mind maps: all seem
                        to be placed perfectly as great as Napoleon Bonaparte would have planned. But as often as we
                        might feel “our goal is just within our reach” we also might suspect that something is missing.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Some trigger to transfer our visions into determined actions, some “secret ingredient”, a
                        true motivation, energy to get us from A to B. How to be in charge of our own motivation?

                    <br>
                    <h4><strong>A POSITIVE APPROACH</strong></h4>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Every strong motivation begins with a positive approach and a vision.
                        It begins with a strong
                        faith in your own power and willingness to change.
                        If you used to be a permanent resident of a “pessimistic kingdom” it’s great you’ve chosen to
                        move somewhere else. It takes a far greater effort to stay in a negative mode than to be synced
                        with a positive one. A person with a positive outlook goes further in life and succeeds in just
                        about everything!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>Positive
                        thinking will let you do everything better <br>than negative thinking will… – Zig
                        Ziglar</em><br/></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">The positive approach begins with counting your blessings and
                        expressing gratitude for all the
                        great things, emotions and people you have in your life and lucky to learn from…
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Thinking positively may be difficult now but this is how we achieve our goals faster. Instead of
                        dragging yourself down with the difficulty of a task at hand, think about how it will make you
                        feel when you complete it. This will bring positive emotions and give you the motivation to go
                        for it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>Be
                        thankful for what you have; you’ll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don’t
                        have, you will never, ever have enough. – Oprah Winfrey</em><br/>
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Next step to reinforce positive thinking is to watch out what you say. The biggest revelation
                        for me was when I learned that our mind does not comprehend negative in sentences. When I say to
                        you “don’t think about a red door”, what do you vividly see in your mind now? A bright red door,
                        perhaps? As kids, remember how our parents used to have the theories about what we could or
                        cannot do? And we often did the exact opposite because that is what we were in fact told to
                        do.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        This is why we know that reverse psychology usually works because the words “don’t” and “can’t”
                        only register with us for a short while, but every other word that follows stays deep in our
                        subconscious. So from now on we will start remembering all the good things in our lives and we
                        will start using positive words instead of negative to keep our motivation high.
