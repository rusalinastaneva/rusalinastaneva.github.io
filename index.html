                        <h2>How to Create a Chain Reaction of Good Habits</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        <br><span
                            style="font-size: 20px;"><em>Human behaviors are often tied to one another.</em><br></span>

                        For example, consider the case of a woman named Jennifer Dukes Lee. For two and a half decades
                        during her adult life, starting when she left for college and extending into her 40s, Lee never
                        made her bed except for when her mother or guests dropped by the house.

                        At some point, she decided to give it another try and managed to make her bed four days in a
                        row—a seemingly trivial feat. However, on the morning of that fourth day, when she finished
                        making the bed, she also picked up a sock and folded a few clothes lying around the bedroom.
                        Next, she found herself in the kitchen, pulling the dirty dishes out of the sink and loading
                        them into the dishwasher, then reorganizing the Tupperware in a cupboard and placing an
                        ornamental pig on the counter as a centerpiece.

                        She later explained, “My act of bed-making had set off a chain of small household tasks… I felt
                        like a grown-up—a happy, legit grown-up with a made bed, a clean sink, one decluttered cupboard,
                        and a pig on the counter. I felt like a woman who had miraculously pulled herself up from the
                        energy-sucking Bermuda Triangle of Household Chaos.”
                        The Domino Effect

                        The Domino Effect states that when you make a change to one behavior it will activate a chain
                        reaction and cause a shift in related behaviors as well.

                        For example, a 2012 study from researchers at Northwestern University found that when people
                        decreased their amount of sedentary leisure time each day, they also reduced their daily fat
                        intake. The participants were never specifically told to eat less fat, but their nutrition
                        habits improved as a natural side effect because they spent less time on the couch watching
                        television and mindlessly eating. One habit led to another, one domino knocked down the next.

                        You may notice similar patterns in your own life. As a personal example, if I stick with my
                        habit of going to the gym, then I naturally find myself more focused at work and sleeping more
                        soundly at night even though I never made a plan to specifically improve either behavior.

                        The Domino Effect holds for negative habits as well. You may find that the habit of checking
                        your phone leads to the habit of clicking social media notifications which leads to the habit of
                        browsing social media mindlessly which leads to another 20 minutes of procrastination.

                        In the words of Stanford professor BJ Fogg, “You can never change just one behavior. Our
                        behaviors are interconnected, so when you change one behavior, other behaviors also shift.”

                        Before we talk about how to get started, I wanted to let you know I researched and compiled
                        science-backed ways to stick to good habits and stop procrastinating. Want to check out my

                        Inside the Domino Effect

                        As best I can tell, the Domino Effect occurs for two reasons.

                        First, many of the habits and routines that make up our daily lives are related to one another.
                        There is an astounding interconnectedness between the systems of life and human behavior is no
                        exception. The inherent relatedness of things is a core reason why choices in one area of life
                        can lead to surprising results in other areas, regardless of the plans you make.

                        Second, the Domino Effect capitalizes on one of the core principles of human behavior:
                        commitment and consistency. This phenomenon is explained in the classic book on human behavior,
                        Influence by Robert Cialdini. The core idea is that if people commit to an idea or goal, even in
                        a very small way, they are more likely to honor that commitment because they now see that idea
                        or goal as being aligned with their self-image.

                        <h2>Motivation: The Scientific Guide on<br>How to Get and Stay Motivated</h2>
                    </header>

                    <br>
                    Motivation is a powerful, yet tricky beast. Sometimes it is really easy to get motivated, and
                    you find yourself wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement. Other times, it is nearly impossible
                    to figure out how to motivate yourself and you're trapped in a death spiral of procrastination.
                    This page contains the best ideas and most useful research on how to get and stay motivated.

                    This isn't going to be some rah-rah, pumped-up motivational speech. (That's not my style.)
                    Instead, we're going to break down the science behind how to get motivated in the first place
                    and how to stay motivated for the long-run. Whether you're trying to figure out how to motivate
                    yourself or how to motivate a team, this page should cover everything you need to know.

                    You can click the links below to jump to a particular section or simply scroll down to read
                    everything. At the end of this page, you'll find a complete list of all the articles I have
                    written on motivation.

                    <br/>
                    <br/><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What is Motivation?</strong><br/></span>
                    <br/>
                    So what is motivation, exactly? The author Steven Pressfield has a great line in his book, The
                    War
                    of Art, which I think gets at the core of motivation. To paraphrase Pressfield, “At some point,
                    the
                    pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.”

                    In other words, at some point, it is easier to change than to stay the same. It is easier to
                    take
                    action and feel insecure at the gym than to sit still and experience self-loathing on the couch.
                    It
                    is easier to feel awkward while making the sales call than to feel disappointed about your
                    dwindling
                    bank account.

                    This, I think, is the essence of motivation. Every choice has a price, but when we are
                    motivated, it
                    is easier to bear the inconvenience of action than the pain of remaining the same. Somehow we
                    cross
                    a mental threshold—usually after weeks of procrastination and in the face of an impending
                    deadline—and it becomes more painful to not do the work than to actually do it.

                    Now for the important question: What can we do to make it more likely that we cross this mental
                    threshold and feel motivated on a consistent basis?

                    <br/>
                    <br/><span
                        style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Common Misconceptions About Motivation</strong><br/></span>
                    <br/>

                    One of the most surprising things about motivation is that it often comes after starting a new
                    behavior, not before. We have this common misconception that motivation arrives as a result of
                    passively consuming a motivational video or reading an inspirational book. However, active
                    inspiration can be a far more powerful motivator.

                    Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. Getting started, even in very
                    small
                    ways, is a form of active inspiration that naturally produces momentum.

                    I like to refer to this effect as the Physics of Productivity because this is basically Newton’s
                    First Law applied to habit formation: Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Once a task has
                    begun, it is easier to continue moving it forward.
