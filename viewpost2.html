                        Often times we are certain about what we want and how to get it. Strategies, mind maps: all seem
                        to be placed perfectly as great as Napoleon Bonaparte would have planned. But as often as we
                        might feel “our goal is just within our reach” we also might suspect that something is missing.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Some trigger to transfer our visions into determined actions, some “secret ingredient”, a
                        true motivation, energy to get us from A to B. How to be in charge of our own motivation?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4><strong>A POSITIVE APPROACH</strong></h4>
<br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Every strong motivation begins with a positive approach and a vision.
                        It begins with a strong
                        faith in your own power and willingness to change.
                        If you used to be a permanent resident of a “pessimistic kingdom” it’s great you’ve chosen to
                        move somewhere else. It takes a far greater effort to stay in a negative mode than to be synced
                        with a positive one. A person with a positive outlook goes further in life and succeeds in just
                        about everything!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>Positive
                        thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will… – Zig
                        Ziglar</em><br/></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">The positive approach begins with counting your blessings and
                        expressing gratitude for all the
                        great things, emotions and people you have in your life and lucky to learn from…
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Thinking positively may be difficult now but this is how we achieve our goals faster. Instead of
                        dragging yourself down with the difficulty of a task at hand, think about how it will make you
                        feel when you complete it. This will bring positive emotions and give you the motivation to go
                        for it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>Be
                        thankful for what you have; you’ll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don’t
                        have, you will never, ever have enough. – Oprah Winfrey</em><br/>
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Next step to reinforce positive thinking is to watch out what you say. The biggest revelation
                        for me was when I learned that our mind does not comprehend negative in sentences. When I say to
                        you “don’t think about a red door”, what do you vividly see in your mind now? A bright red door,
                        perhaps? As kids, remember how our parents used to have the theories about what we could or
                        cannot do? And we often did the exact opposite because that is what we were in fact told to
                        do.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        This is why we know that reverse psychology usually works because the words “don’t” and “can’t”
                        only register with us for a short while, but every other word that follows stays deep in our
                        subconscious. So from now on we will start remembering all the good things in our lives and we
                        will start using positive words instead of negative to keep our motivation high.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        What is it that makes you tick? Do you have a hobby? Or is there some of you out there who is
                        following their passion into a full-time occupation that brings you nothing but joy,
                        inspiration, and more motivation to go further?

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Explore your passions, do what you love. Even if it’s something you do on the weekends – find
                        the time to pursue that something special that makes you happy. Discover, create and go further!
                        Try something new! This will always keep you motivated to go far beyond your “limits” that you
                        carefully set for yourself!

                    <p>Change can be scary, but what is even scarier is looking back and regretting having not made
                        those changes. It is important to live a life you are proud of. Ask yourself ‘Is what I am doing
                        making my happy? Is it enhancing my life? Do I look forward to waking up in the morning? If you
                        are unable to answer yes to these questions I hope you are able to find the strength to make a
                        change and begin something new.</p>
                    <p>And how exciting it is to break those limits! You will only look
                        back to your old self and laugh at how you could not believe that something was possible.

                    <h4><strong>THE POWER OF RECHARGING</strong></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Sometimes we are stewing just a bit too much in sets of the same tasks and environment. This
                        makes us lose our creative approach or even sweep our focused mind away. It’s about time to
                        switch and twist things around and turn our minds for a while to something different.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Nothing recharges the batteries better than a new activity. Be
                        careful, though, recharging
                        batteries does not mean sit down and do something meaningless. If your task requires brain
                        activity then the best way to recharge is to switch to something more physical. If you have been
                        laying bricks and lifting things all day, then there is nothing better than to sit down with
                        your favourite book and give your mind a nice workout.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">When you invest time and attention in a creative hobby, as with
                        reading, you provide your mind
                        with a much-needed escape from your day-to-day stressors. You jump into a zone that has no
                        pressures, deadlines, or rules, and provide your mind with a chance to recharge. Whether you’re
                        into writing, painting, or woodworking, investing time in a creative hobby is a fantastic way to
                        supercharge your brain.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Reading is a powerful way to provide your mind with an escape, and
                        one study found that reading
                        can reduce your mental stress by an astounding 68% because, “your mind is invited into a
                        literary world that is free from the stressors that plague your daily life.”</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">An important note: This has been written from a personal perspective.
                        As a leader it is important
                        to recharge for yourself, so you’ll be a better and leader . . . and because it’s an important
                        to encourage your team members to reduce stress and recharge themselves too. If you believe the
                        actions you just read will increase your energy, teaching and modeling these ideas to others is
                        a great way to lead and make a difference for others – increasing productivity in the
                        process.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4><strong>MAKE IT SIMPLE</strong></h4>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>The
                        ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecesary so that the necessary may speak.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Make it simple! Declutter your thoughts, relationships, homes from
                        old and unwanted things.
                        Simplifying your life also means accepting that people think differently and have different
                        values. This will lift a lot of weight from worrying about someone not appreciating your
                        passions as much as you do and trying to make others change their mind. Re-evaluating difficult
                        relationships and letting go is one of the most important things that you can do to make your
                        life simpler. Once you’ve done that, have a look around. How many unnecessary things do you
                        have? How much sentimental value can that stone you picked up on a beach a few years back can
                        really hold? Make a list of those things you want out from your life. No way back. Just a
                        feeling of liberation and space for something new and valuable!</p>

                    <h4><strong>SPORT IT UP</strong></h4>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Sport can be fun as long as you like what you are doing. It can be
                        running, boxing, pilates,
                        yoga, body balance, body combat, Zumba, spinning class etc. Do understand the importance of
                        keeping the heart healthy (cardio exercises). The main idea is to find something appealing in
                        sport and do it as often as you can. Sport really keeps us motivated.</p>

                    <h4><strong>BETTER NUTRITION CHOICES</strong></h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Good nutrition directly affects our wellness. Our wellness directly
                        affects our performance and
                        productivity. Here is a simple rule to follow: eat more veggies and fruits than junk food; drink
                        more water than coffee and soda drinks</p>
                    <p>I am addicted to coffee. If there was a bucket of coffee, I would drink it. Then I became aware
                        and amazed about just how little of water I drank. “Drinking enough water is a key element for
                        maintaining your health and general well-being. Increasing your daily intake of water helps keep
                        your skin looking vibrant and younger, aids digestion, improves your concentration and helps to
                        remove toxins from your body.” There is also an app I use to track my water intake Drink More
                        Water</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>Once you
                        have mastered time, you will understand how true it is that most people overestimate what they
                        can accomplish in a year – and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade! – Tony
                        Robbins</em>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Every tv show watched, every junk magazine read, disappearing into
                        the wild of social networks
                        and every gossip session with your mates – clutters your life and renders your mind out of
                        focus. This is also stealing your time that you could have spent doing something that would
                        bring you a little bit closer to your dreams. Think about all of those annoying little things
                        that steal your time and evaluate what’s more important to you: time wasting or spending time
                        leaving your dent in this world?! Be a master of your own time management.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Even the smallest effort today can improve all tomorrows. When you
                        are at the beginning of
                        pursuing your dream the whole task may seem unbearable at once, but it’s just an opinion. Learn
                        to delegate and separate huge tasks into smaller ones. By achieving each of those smaller tasks
                        you will feel more and more reinforced and eager to go further! The further you go accomplishing
                        your goals the higher your motivation will be at which point everything you do is possible and
                        easy!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 3px; padding-top: 5px"><em>It is in
                        the small decisions you and I make every day that create our destiny – Tony Robbins</em>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Everything you do and every step you take should be well celebrated
                        within you. Fears of losing
                        or not having enough time, or not succeeding at something should be put aside all at once! You
                        are trying to get there – it counts more than never even daring to dream about achieving
                        something. There is no such thing as a negative result, there is a life experience that every
                        event brings you and makes you wiser. Every time you are successful and you achieve something –
                        stop for a moment and give yourself a pat on the back. Well done you! This is great! Keep doing
                        whatever you are doing because it is working!</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">I read a lot. So I came across one good advice (although I cannot
                        recall where exactly) but it
                        goes something like this: take at least 20 mins out of your day for a walk or find a good spot
                        for visualisation. During the week it’s hard to make time and reunite with nature, I know.
                        However, at least, we can try to find some time for a simple fresh air walk. I guess I am
                        extremely lucky currently living 20 meters from the River Thames which makes my visualisation
                        outings possible and bring me an extra pleasure when I walk along the river and stare into the
                        water. It clears my mind and gives me a new perspective. Think about your special “places of
                        power” that give you true inspiration and make a habit to be there more often.</p>

                    <h4><strong>SELF-DEVELOPMENT IS NEVER AN OPTION, IT'S A MUST!</strong></h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">People who seek true motivation are those who are always on the road
                        of self-development and
                        self-improvement! The best way is to read more, to communicate more and strive for new things to
                        experience. If sport is a remedy for our body, the book is a remedy for our minds that absorb
                        new knowledge as a good sponge. Think about the area you are interested in the most. Take
                        training and courses to expand your knowledge and skills. Whatever you are into – stay
                        interested in exploring life and you will grant your motivation to go even further.</p>
