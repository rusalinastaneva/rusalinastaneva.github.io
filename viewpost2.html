                        <h2>Motivation: The Scientific Guide on<br>How to Get and Stay Motivated</h2>
                    </header>

                    <br>
                    Motivation is a powerful, yet tricky beast. Sometimes it is really easy to get motivated, and
                    you find yourself wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement. Other times, it is nearly impossible
                    to figure out how to motivate yourself and you're trapped in a death spiral of procrastination.
                    This page contains the best ideas and most useful research on how to get and stay motivated.

                    This isn't going to be some rah-rah, pumped-up motivational speech. (That's not my style.)
                    Instead, we're going to break down the science behind how to get motivated in the first place
                    and how to stay motivated for the long-run. Whether you're trying to figure out how to motivate
                    yourself or how to motivate a team, this page should cover everything you need to know.

                    You can click the links below to jump to a particular section or simply scroll down to read
                    everything. At the end of this page, you'll find a complete list of all the articles I have
                    written on motivation.

                    <br/><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What is Motivation?</strong><br/></span>
                    <br/>
                    So what is motivation, exactly? The author Steven Pressfield has a great line in his book, The
                    War
                    of Art, which I think gets at the core of motivation. To paraphrase Pressfield, “At some point,
                    the
                    pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.”

                    In other words, at some point, it is easier to change than to stay the same. It is easier to
                    take
                    action and feel insecure at the gym than to sit still and experience self-loathing on the couch.
                    It
                    is easier to feel awkward while making the sales call than to feel disappointed about your
                    dwindling
                    bank account.

                    This, I think, is the essence of motivation. Every choice has a price, but when we are
                    motivated, it
                    is easier to bear the inconvenience of action than the pain of remaining the same. Somehow we
                    cross
                    a mental threshold—usually after weeks of procrastination and in the face of an impending
                    deadline—and it becomes more painful to not do the work than to actually do it.

                    Now for the important question: What can we do to make it more likely that we cross this mental
                    threshold and feel motivated on a consistent basis?

                        style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Common Misconceptions About Motivation</strong><br/></span>
                    <br/>

                    One of the most surprising things about motivation is that it often comes after starting a new
                    behavior, not before. We have this common misconception that motivation arrives as a result of
                    passively consuming a motivational video or reading an inspirational book. However, active
                    inspiration can be a far more powerful motivator.

                    Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. Getting started, even in very
                    small
                    ways, is a form of active inspiration that naturally produces momentum.

                    I like to refer to this effect as the Physics of Productivity because this is basically Newton’s
                    First Law applied to habit formation: Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Once a task has
                    begun, it is easier to continue moving it forward.
